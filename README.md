# The Picnic Game

Connor Williams 2021

This program is The Picnic Game and it takes any number of names,
assigns them to a list, asks what item each user wants to bring to
a picnic, then traverses through the names and picnic items matching
whether the first letter of both words match. If so, then the user
can come, otherwise the user cannot come to the picnic.

This was created as a homework assignment for my CS 161 - Introduction
to Programs and Problem Solving class at Portland State University.
